<h2>Raja Ampat</h2>

<img class="img_article" src="gambar/rajaampat.jpg" alt="rajaampat">
<p>Raja Ampat, is a regency and groups of islands that located in the tip of Bird's Head Peninsula on the island of New Guinea, 
precisely in West Papua province. Raja Ampat has 610 islands, which is only 35 islands that have been inhabited, 
the rest areun inhabited and even nameless. The famous islands in Raja Ampat are Misool island, Salawati, Batanta, and Waigeo island.
The area of Raja Ampat is often touted as the best reef areas in the world. The marine biota has beauty that can easily captivated by the tourists.
The origin name of Raja Ampat,according to local myth, is coming from a woman who found seven eggs. 
Four grains of which hatch into four princes who separated and each became the king who ruled in Waigeo, Salawati, East Misool and West Misool. 
Meanwhile, three other eggs became a ghost, a woman, and a stone. 
The area's massive coral colonies along with relatively high sea surface temperatures, also suggest that its reefs may be relatively 
resistant to threats like coral bleaching and coral disease, which now jeopardize the survival of other coral ecosystems around the world. 
The Raja Ampat islands are remote and relatively undisturbed by humans.</p>
