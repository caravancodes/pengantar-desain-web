		   The area of Raja Ampat is often touted as the best reef areas in the world. The marine biota has beauty that can easily captivated by the tourists.
	  	   The origin name of Raja Ampat,according to local myth, is coming from a woman who found seven eggs. 
	 	   Four grains of which hatch into four princes who separated and each became the king who ruled in Waigeo, Salawati, East Misool and West Misool. 
		   Meanwhile, three other eggs became a ghost, a woman, and a stone.

		   resistant to threats like coral bleaching and coral disease, which now jeopardize the survival of other coral ecosystems around the world. 
		   The Raja Ampat islands are remote and relatively undisturbed by humans.</color></p>
